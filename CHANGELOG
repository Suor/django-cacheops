2.0
- conditions on related models will now invalidate queryset
- m2m invalidation is much more granular
- removed requirement that timeout should not be greater than default
- lua scripting is used to save and invalidate cache, making things faster
- better invalidation for complex and custom fields
- silent stringify of unknown objects by default
- support caching django.contrib.gis queries (koodjo)
- cacheops is now thread-safe
- added a way to no-op cacheops
- added @cached_view() and @cached_view_as()
- pass several samples for @cached_as() and @cached_view_as()
- fixed working with querysets created by non-patched constructor (#3 and dups)
- fixed invalidate_model() for proxy models
- fixed deepcopy(queryset) bug
- fixed possible collisions when cached functions passed complex structured arguments
- fixed StringifyError on timedelta (mpyatishev)
Backwards incompatible changes:
- filters on TextFields no longer affect invalidation
- @cached_as() cache key will now depend on function arguments
- @cached_as() and @cached() will now depend on function line in a code,
  permitting usage of lambdas and same named methods without passing extra
- @cached_as() and @cached() will now take timeout as first argument and extra as second.
  Anyway using them as keyword arguments is recommended
- Django 1.2 no longer supported
- Redis 2.6+ is required

1.3.1

1.3.0
